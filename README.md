#### DevOps
* Combination of the development of our code paired with the operation of our code.
* Code -> build -> Test -> Deploy -> maintenance -> evaluation

#### Continuous integration  
* All developers push and pull code to a central repository accompanied with automatic builds and testing. 
* Helps us fail fast to see what code works and what does not

#### Continuous Delivery 
* Successful builds which pass automated tests are stored in a staging area where they can be marked for deployment into the market. You might have a human assurance testing team at work before deployment.

#### Continuous deployment
* If all tests are passed then the application can go immediately live and available to end users without any human approval
